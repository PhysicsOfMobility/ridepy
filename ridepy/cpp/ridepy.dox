 * \defgroup RidePy
 * \brief The C++ interface of the RidePy package.
 *
 * This library can be included in other C++ projects using CMake:
 * Assuming, the root directory of the RidePy repository is stored in \p RIDEPY_PATH, then it remains to add
 * \code
 * add_subdirectory(${RIDEPY_PATH}/ridepy/cpp)
 * \endcode
 * to your \p CMakeLists.txt. Then, RidePy headers can be included via
 * \code
 * #include "ridepy/*.h"
 * \endcode
