  abstract = {Previous studies into the potential benefits of ride pooling failed to account for the trade-off that users likely make when considering a shared ride. We address this shortcoming by formulating user net benefit stemming from pooling as a compensatory function where the additional travel time and on-board discomfort need to be compensated by the price discount for a traveller to choose a pooled ride over a private ride. The proposed formulation is embedded in a method for matching travel requests and vehicles. We conduct a series of experiments investigating how the potential of ride-pooling services depends on demand characteristics, user preferences and the pricing policy adopted by the service provider. Our results suggest that the total vehicle mileage savings found by previous studies is only attainable when users are very willing to share their ride (i.e. attach low premium to private rides) and are offered a 50\% discount for doing so.},

  abstract = {Autonomous on-demand mobility systems, especially ride-pooling services, except for providing convenient transportation for the people, could potentially improve the traffic congestion in urban environments by reducing the number of private vehicles. In this paper, we introduce an Autonomous On-Demand Ride-Pooling (AODRP) system, which uses a rather realistic customer-model that is sensitive to waiting times. To quantify the benefits that the AODRP system could have on a city network, a case study in Munich is performed with a shared fleet of vehicles. Different scenarios, in which private vehicle trips are partly replaced with ride-pooling trips until an adoption rate of 15\%, are investigated for varying allowed customer detour times. The results show that the benefits of an AODRP service are observed from a certain adoption rate. For low demand level of 1\%, the ride-pooling service even increases Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) in the system, due to the empty trips generated while going to pick up customers. For higher adoption rates, pooling makes up for the additional empty VMT starting from approximately 5\% adoption rate. An analysis of change in VMT per road type reveals that the AODRP system especially reduces traffic on major roads, in which nowadays the highest level of congestion is observed, while extra VMT due to empty pick-up trips are concentrated on minor roads.},

  abstract = {The market share of mobility on-demand (MoD) services strongly increased in recent years and is expected to rise even higher once vehicle automation is fully available. These services might reduce space consumption in cities as fewer parking spaces are required if private vehicle trips are replaced. If rides are shared additionally, occupancy related traffic efficiency is increased. Simulations help to identify the actual impact of MoD on a traffic system, evaluate new control algorithms for improved service efficiency and develop guidelines for regulatory measures. This paper presents the open-source agent-based simulation framework FleetPy. FleetPy (written in the programming language "Python") is explicitly developed to model MoD services in a high level of detail. It specially focuses on the modeling of interactions of users with operators while its flexibility allows the integration and embedding of multiple operators in the overall transportation system. Its modular structure ensures the transferabillity of previously developed elements and the selection of an appropriate level of modeling detail. This paper compares existing simulation frameworks for MoD services and highlights exclusive features of FleetPy. The upper level simulation flows are presented, followed by required input data for the simulation and the output data FleetPy produces. Additionally, the modules within FleetPy and high-level descriptions of current implementations are provided. Finally, an example showcase for Manhattan, NYC provides insights into the impacts of different modules for simulation flow, fleet optimization, traveler behavior and network representation.},

  abstract = {Ride-haling such as Uber and Lyft are changing the ways people travel. Despite widespread claims that these services help reduce driving, there is little research on this topic. This research paper uses a quasi-natural experiment in the Denver, Colorado, region to analyze basic impacts of ride-hailing on transportation efficiency in terms of deadheading, vehicle occupancy, mode replacement, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Realizing the difficulty in obtaining data directly from Uber and Lyft, we designed a quasi-natural experiment{\textemdash}by one of the authors driving for both companies{\textemdash}to collect primary data. This experiment uses an ethnographic and survey-based approach that allows the authors to gain access to exclusive data and real-time passenger feedback. The dataset includes actual travel attributes from 416 ride-hailing rides{\textemdash}Lyft, UberX, LyftLine, and UberPool{\textemdash}and travel behavior and socio-demographics from 311 passenger surveys. For this study, the conservative (lower end) percentage of deadheading miles from ride-hailing is 40.8\%. The average vehicle occupancy is 1.4 passengers per ride, while the distance weighted vehicle occupancy is 1.3 without accounting for deadheading and 0.8 when accounting deadheading. When accounting for mode replacement and issues such as driver deadheading, we estimate that ride-hailing leads to approximately 83.5\% more VMT than would have been driven had ride-hailing not existed. Although our data collection focused on the Denver region, these results provide insight into the impacts of ride-hailing.},

  abstract = {Two-sided mobility platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, widely emerged in the urban mobility landscape. Distributed supply of individual drivers, matched with travellers via intermediate platform yields a new class of phenomena not present in urban mobility before. Such disruptive changes to transportation systems call for a simulation framework where researchers from various and across disciplines may introduce models aimed at representing the complex dynamics of platform-driven urban mobility. In this work, we present MaaSSim, a lightweight agent-based simulator reproducing the transport system used by two kinds of agents: (i) travellers, requesting to travel from their origin to destination at a given time, and (ii) drivers supplying their travel needs by offering them rides. An intermediate agent, the platform, matches demand with supply. Agents are individual decision-makers. Specifically, travellers may decide which mode they use or reject an incoming offer; drivers may opt-out from the system or reject incoming requests. All of the above behaviours are modelled through user-defined modules, allowing to represent agents' taste variations (heterogeneity), their previous experiences (learning) and available information (system control). MaaSSim is a flexible open-source python library capable of realistically reproducing complex interactions between agents of a two-sided mobility platform. MaaSSim is available from a public repository, along with a set of tutorials and reproducible use-case scenarios, as demonstrated with a series of illustrative examples and a comprehensive case study.},

  abstract = {Ride sharing{\textemdash}the bundling of simultaneous trips of several people in one vehicle{\textemdash}may help to reduce the carbon footprint of human mobility. However, the complex collective dynamics pose a challenge when predicting the efficiency and sustainability of ride sharing systems. Standard door-to-door ride sharing services trade reduced route length for increased user travel times and come with the burden of many stops and detours to pick up individual users. Requiring some users to walk to nearby shared stops reduces detours, but could become inefficient if spatio-temporal demand patterns do not well fit the stop locations. Here, we present a simple model of dynamic stop pooling with flexible stop positions. We analyze the performance of ride sharing services with and without stop pooling by numerically and analytically evaluating the steady state dynamics of the vehicles and requests of the ride sharing service. Dynamic stop pooling does a priori not save route length, but occupancy. Intriguingly, it also reduces the travel time, although users walk parts of their trip. Together, these insights explain how dynamic stop pooling may break the trade-off between route lengths and travel time in door-to-door ride sharing, thus enabling higher sustainability and service quality.

Ride-sharing poses an appealing alternative to personal cars, combining the traffic-reducing ride bundling of public transport with much of the flexibility and comfort of personal cars. Here we study the effects of the underlying street network topology on the viability of ride bundling analytically and in simulations. Using numerical and analytical approaches we find that system performance can be measured in the number of scheduled stops per vehicle. Its scaling with the request rate is approximately linear and the slope, that depends on the network topology, is a measure of the ease of ridesharing in that topology. This dependence is caused by the different growth of the route volume, which we compute analytically for the simplest networks served by a single vehicle.},

Their collective dynamics intricately depend on the topology of the underlying street network, the spatiotemporal demand distribution, and the dispatching algorithm. The efficiency of ride-sharing fleets is thus hard to quantify and compare in a unified way. Here, we derive an efficiency observable from the collective nonlinear dynamics and show that it exhibits a universal scaling law. For any given dispatcher, we find a common scaling that yields data collapse across qualitatively different topologies of model networks and empirical street networks from cities, islands, and rural areas. A mean-field analysis confirms this view and reveals a single scaling parameter that jointly captures the influence of network topology and demand distribution. These results further our conceptual understanding of the collective dynamics of ride-sharing fleets and support the evaluation of ride-sharing services and their transfer to previously unserviced regions or unprecedented demand patterns.},

One potential benefit of ride sharing is increased system efficiency. However, it is not clear what the trade-offs are between the efficiency gains and the reduction in quality of service. To quantify those trade-offs, an open-source simulation environment is introduced, which is capable of evaluating a large class of operational policies for ride-sharing mobility-on-demand systems. The impact of ride sharing on efficiency and service level is assessed for several benchmark operational policies from the literature and for different transportation scenarios: first a dense urban scenario, then a line-shaped, rural one. Based on the results of these case studies, we find that the efficiency gains in ride sharing are relatively small and potentially hard to justify against quality of service concerns such as reduced convenience, loss of privacy, and higher total travel and drive times. Furthermore, in the assessed scenarios, the relatively low occupancy of the vehicles suggests that smaller vehicles with 4-6 seats, able to handle occasional ride sharing, may be preferable to larger and more expensive vehicles such as minibuses.},

  abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network, which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting toward a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the coupling of a state-of-the-art ride-pooling fleet simulation package with the mobiTopp travel demand modeling framework. The coupling of both models enables a detailed agent- and activity-based demand model, in which travelers have the option to use ride-pooling based on real-time offers of an optimized ride-pooling operation. On the one hand, this approach allows the application of detailed mode-choice models based on agent-level attributes coming from mobiTopp functionalities. On the other hand, existing state-of-the-art ride-pooling optimization can be applied to utilize the full potential of ride-pooling. The introduced interface allows mode choice based on real-time fleet information and thereby does not require multiple iterations per simulated day to achieve a balance of ride-pooling demand and supply. The introduced methodology is applied to a case study of an example model where in total approximately 70,000 trips are performed. Simulations with a simplified mode-choice model with varying fleet size (0{\textendash}150 vehicles), fares, and further fleet operators' settings show that (i) ride-pooling can be a very attractive alternative to existing modes and (ii) the fare model can affect the mode shifts to ride-pooling. Depending on the scenario, the mode share of ride-pooling is between 7.6\% and 16.8\% and the average distance-weighed occupancy of the ride-pooling fleet varies between 0.75 and 1.17.},

  abstract = {The growing urban transport sector presents towns and cities with an escalating challenge in the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions. Here we assess the effectiveness of several widely considered policy options (electrification, light-weighting, retrofitting, scrapping, regulated manufacturing standards and modal shift) in achieving the transition to sustainable urban mobility in terms of their emissions and energy impact until 2050. Our analysis investigates the severity of actions needed to comply with Paris compliant regional sub-sectoral carbon budgets. We introduce the Urban Transport Policy Model (UTPM) for passenger car fleets and use London as an urban case study to show that current policies are insufficient to meet climate targets. We conclude that, as well as implementation of emission-reducing changes in vehicle design, a rapid and large-scale reduction in car use is necessary to meet stringent carbon budgets and avoid high energy demand. Yet, without increased consensus in sub-national and sectoral carbon budgets, the scale of reduction necessary stays uncertain. Nevertheless, it is certain we need to act urgently and intensively across all policy mechanisms available as well as developing new policy options.},

  abstract = {Ride-pooling (or ride-sharing) services combine trips of multiple customers along similar routes into a single vehicle. The collective dynamics of the fleet of ride-pooling vehicles fundamentally underlies the efficiency of these services. In simplified models, the common features of these dynamics give rise to scaling laws of the efficiency that are valid across a wide range of street networks and demand settings. However, it is unclear how constraints of the vehicle fleet impact such scaling laws. Here, we map the collective dynamics of capacity-constrained ride-pooling fleets to services with unlimited passenger capacity and identify an effective fleet size of available vehicles as the relevant scaling parameter characterizing the dynamics. Exploiting this mapping, we generalize the scaling laws of ride-pooling efficiency to capacity-constrained fleets. We approximate the scaling function with a queueing theoretical analysis of the dynamics in a minimal model system, thereby enabling mean-field predictions of required fleet sizes in more complex settings. These results may help to transfer insights from existing ride-pooling services to new settings or service locations.},

We analyze a) a laissez-faire scenario without additional policies, defining the modal shift through an incremental mode choice model and b) a draconian scenario in which each within-city car trip is replaced by ride-pooling. Results indicate a logarithmic increase in system efficiency with increasing trip densities. While the results confirm the potential of ride-pooling systems to reduce private car fleets drastically, a reduction of traveled km is identified for scenarios with more than 1,000 requests per km2 per day.},

  abstract = {On-demand ride-pooling systems have gained increasing attention in science and practice in recent years. Simulation studies have shown an enormous potential to reduce fleet sizes and vehicle kilometers traveled if private car trips are replaced with ride-pooling services. However, existing simulation studies assume operation with autonomous vehicles, with no restrictions on operational tasks required when the vehicles are operated by manual drivers. In this article, we simulate and evaluate the operational challenges of non-autonomous ride-pooling systems through driver shifts and breaks and compare their capacity and efficiency to autonomous on-demand services. Based on the existing ride-pooling service MOIA in Hamburg, Germany, we introduce shift and break schedules and implement a new hub return logic to perform the respective tasks at different types of vehicle hubs. This way, currently operating on-demand services are modeled more realistically and the efficiency gains of such services through autonomous vehicles are quantified. The results suggest that operational challenges substantially limit the ride-pooling capacity in terms of served rides with a given number of vehicles. While results largely depend on the chosen shift plan, the presented operational factors should be considered for the assessment of current operational real-world services. The contribution of this study is threefold: From a technical perspective, it is shown that the explicit simulation of operational constraints of current services is crucial to assess ride-pooling services. From a policy perspective, the study shows the operational challenges of a ride-pooling service with non-autonomous vehicles and the potential of future autonomous services. Lastly, the paper adds to the literature a practical ride-pooling simulation use case based on observed real-world demand and shift data.},
