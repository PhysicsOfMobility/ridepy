The cythonic components
=======================
The module structure of the cythonic components mimics exactly that of their pythonic
counterparts, so that in most cases a user wishing to switch to cythonic components can
just change their import statements from 

.. code-block:: python

    from thesimulator.data_structures import Stop

to

.. code-block:: python

    from thesimulator.data_structures_cython import Stop
