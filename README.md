# theSimulator
Simulates a dispatching algorithm serving exogeneous transportation requests with a fleet of vehicles. Does not simulate the universe, unlike MATSIM.

## Instructions
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8
* git

You should probably use an environment. For example, using [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/):
```sh
conda create -n the_simulator python=3.8
conda activate the_simulator
```

### Installation
```sh
git clone git@github.com:PhysicsOfMobility/theSimulator.git
cd theSimulator
pre-commit install
pytest
```

## First Steps
- Start `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
- Open one of the introductory notebooks in the `notebooks` subdirectory, either just by
  clicking on it (`jupyter notebook`) or right-clicking and chosing `Open With >
  Notebook`.
- Run the notebook and play around :)

## Contributing
Generally branch from `master`, implement stuffÂ® and file a pull request back to
`master`. Feel free to do the latter at an early stage, prefixing the pull request with
"WIP:".
- `master` should always improve. Incomplete functionality is welcome.
- `production` should always be usable and, if possible, not break things.

### Testing
- for each new feature introduced, tests should be written, using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework
- running tests is easy--just execute `pytest` in the project directory
- additional pointers for running pytest:
    - drop into a debugger on failing test through `pytest --pdb`
    - show stdout `pytest -s`
    - run specific test by matching test function name string `pytest -k <match expression>`
    - be more verbose `pytest -v`
- Warning 1: Pytest may cause confusion as it automagically imports stuff and supplies function
  with stuff they need based on their signature. For this, e.g. see the docs on
  [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html).
- Warning 2: Warning 1 applies in particular to stuff hiding in innocent-looking
  files named `conftest.py`. See docs on
  [conftest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/2.7.3/plugins.html).

## Principles
### Jargon
- **estimated arrival time**, also Cached Predicted Arrival Time CPAT
- **time window min**, also Earliest Allowed Service Time EAST
- **time window max**, also Latest Allowed Service Time LAST
- **stoplist**, a sequence of scheduled stops that a transporter must *service*,
  i.e. perform the action defined in the respective stop's `Stop.action`
- dummy stop **current position element CPE** always must be the first entry of each stoplist,
  denoting the current location of the transporter.
- transporter, vehicle, bus, car

### General Things
- The dispatcher is responsible for keeping the state of the stoplists valid.
 This means e.g. recomputing the estimated arrival times and making sure that
  the order of the stops in the stoplist follows the order of the estimated
  arrival times. It also includes managing the CPE.
