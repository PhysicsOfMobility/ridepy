RidePy
======

RidePy is a scientific Python library for simulating modern on-demand transit systems such as ridepooling.

In short: RidePy simulates a dispatching algorithm serving exogenous transportation requests with a fleet of vehicles. Does not simulate the universe, unlike MATSim. Batteries are included.
